# Subcommander: Parsing CLI commands with Go

This is a basic set of wrappers around Go's stock `flag` package that I am using across a few projects.

It is _so_ basic that I'm not even sure it makes sense as a package of its own -- perhaps I will end up folding this code back into the individual projects, customizing it for each project, and deleting this repository. Or switching to one of several other libraries that accomplish the same thing. So I would not recommend that anyone else use this package, except as an example of the use of `flag`.
